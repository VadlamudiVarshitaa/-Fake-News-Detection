Fake-News-Detection In today's digital age, the spread of fake news is a significant concern, as it can lead to misinformation and its harmful effects. This project aims to combat the spread of fake news by utilizing machine learning techniques to verify the legitimacy of information. Using Python, TfidfVectorizer, and PassiveAggressiveClassifier, the project builds a model that can effectively distinguish between real and fake news articles.

# How to Use the Code
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the cloned repository.
- Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using.
- Open the Jupyter Notebook.
- Follow the instructions in the fake_news.ipynb notebook to load the datasets (Fake.csv and True.csv), preprocess the data, and build the fake news detection model.

# Key Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling, including text normalization and vectorization using TfidfVectorizer.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the datasets to understand the distribution and characteristics of fake and real news articles.
- Model Building: Implementing the PassiveAggressiveClassifier to create a robust fake news detection model.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Prediction: Making predictions on new articles to classify them as real or fake news.
